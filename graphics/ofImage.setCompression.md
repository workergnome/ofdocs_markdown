This sets the compression level used when creating mipmaps for the ofTexture contained by the ofImage. This is quite different than the ofImageQualityType image quality parameter used in saveImage(). The different texture compression levels are:
    OF_COMPRESS_NONE,
    OF_COMPRESS_SRGB,
    OF_COMPRESS_ARB

The ofImage is a useful object for loading, saving and drawing images in openFrameworks. ofImage is a convenient class that lets you both draw images to the screen and manipulate their pixel data. The ofImage allows you to load an image from disk, manipulate the pixels, and create an OpenGL texture that you can display and manipulate on the graphics card. Loading a file into the ofImage allocates an ofPixels object and creates the ofTexture to display the pixels.

ofImage uses a library called "freeImage" under the hood.

This method should be called after you update the pixels of the image and want to ensure that the changes to the pixels are reflected in the ofTexture of the image. Many of the ofImage methods call this after they change the pixels, but if you directly manipulate the pixels of the ofImage, then you should make sure to call update() before trying to draw the texture of the image to the screen.

The alpha value (transparency) of a color. 0 is completely transparent, 255 is completely opaque.


```{cpp.}
    ofColor c = ofColor(255,0,0); // Bright red with default limit() value (this case its 255)
    c.a = 50; // now the color is bright red with the opacity set to 50 (mostly see through)
```

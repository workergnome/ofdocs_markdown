Divide all color components by brightness. This has the effect of conforming the color to the outer surface of the hue/saturation/brightness spherical color space, by forcing a unit radius (brightness).

The following
```cpp
	ofColor c(122, 122, 0);
	ofSetColor(c);
	ofDrawCircle(100, 100, 100);
	c.normalize();
	ofSetColor(c);
	ofDrawCircle(300, 100, 100);
```

will create this:

![ofNorm](../images/ofColor.normalize.example.png)

Return a 24 bit hexidecimal number representing this color.

```cpp
ofColor c( 255, 255, 0 ); // yellow
int hex = c.getHex(); // hex is 0xffff00 (or 16776960 in decimal)
```

Usually when we look at these colors in print they're hex, so don't be 
surprised if they don't look familiar when you print them as decimal.

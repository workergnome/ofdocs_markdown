Draws the internal texture of the movie grabber class at the position (x,y) with the given width (w) and height (h). As the video grabber operates, it grabs pixel data and uploads it to it's internal texture (ie, on the GPU), unless you call setUseTexture(false), which disables the texture uploading. This draws that internal texture on screen.

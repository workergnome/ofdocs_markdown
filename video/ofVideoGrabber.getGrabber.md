getGrabber returns a pointer (ofPtr) to the internally running video grabber. Since the ofVideoGrabber object has different potential systems for grabbing (QuickTime, QTKit, DirectShow), this ptr gives you access to the underlying video grabber that's running inside of ofVideoGrabber. Note: use this only if you need low level access to an internal grabbing object, such as to call a specific function.

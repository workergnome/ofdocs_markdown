Sets the playback-head to the position (pct) specified. 0.0 - 1.0 range. 0.0 is the beginning of the sound file and 1.0 is the end.

Example:
```cpp
ofSoundPlayer mySound;
mySound.load("beat.mp3");
mySound.play();
mySound.setPosition(0.5f); //Moves the playhead to halfway through the sound
mySound.setPosition(0.0f); //Moves the playhead back to the beginning of the sound
```

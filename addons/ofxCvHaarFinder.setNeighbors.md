Minimum number (minus 1) of neighbor rectangles that makes up an object. All the groups of a smaller number of rectangles than min_neighbors-1 are rejected. If min_neighbors is 0, the function does not any grouping at all and returns all the detected candidate rectangles, that might be useful if you want to do a customized grouping.

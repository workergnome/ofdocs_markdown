This returns a 3x3 matrix with the following values set:

First column is gravity vector.
Second column as an arbitrary vector in the plane perpendicular to the gravity vector {Gx, Gy, Gz} defined by by the equation "Gx * x + Gy * y + Gz * z = 0" in which we arbitrarily set x=0 and y=1.
Third column as the cross product of the first two.

This is important because the message delimiter used by your client has to match what your sever is using. If the server uses '[\TCP]', which is the default for ofxTCPClient and ofxTCPServer, then your client needs to do the same so that the server knows when a message has ended. ofxTCPServer allows you to use whatever delimiter you want.
